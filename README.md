# WebDevCode
This is all of my code for thew websites that I am creating whilst following along with Leon Noel's 100Devs program. EVERY that I write will be able to be found in this folder. If you too are in the 100Dev's program, please do not just copy what I did.
Actually go and learn. If you are using this as a resource, go ahead, but please at least try to understand what the things you are typing do. Don't just insert <h4>Wow</h4> just because you saw thats what I did. Understand why I did that, and what that <h4> tag
even means in the first place. Hope you have fun while overviewing my code. Hope you have a wonderful day!
